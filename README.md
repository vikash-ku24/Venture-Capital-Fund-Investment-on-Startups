# Venture-Capital-Fund-Investment-on-Startups
There is a Venture Capital Fund that is planning to do investment in Startups on the basis of:
1. High Revenue 
2. Low Expense 
3. Top Growth

Here I try to solve the business problem by identifying the best startups to invest in on the basis of 2015 Growth Rate, 2015 Revenue, and 2015 Expenses.

I created a dashboard for the Board of Directors through which they can find the best opportunities to invest in future unicorns*

This list consists of 1000 startups name through which investors can find the top performer dynamically,
For e.g., if the capital fund wants to invest in the top 10 startups then the dashboard will show the top 10 startups and in case they want more or less then the dashboard has a dynamic set that helps them to find the top 5 or top 20 etc startups out of 1000.

The dashboard will represent the list of all the top companies alongside Growth Rate, Revenue, Expense.
The business leaders can adjust the cutoff according to their expectancy using different parameters such as revenue cutoff, expense cutoff(these cutoffs can go from its actual minimum to actual maximum)

I'm including two files:-
1. EDA which helps you to understand the data analysis process and the whole preparation of raw data
2. The dashboard which helps you to find the top startups along side with other modifications like:
      a. Reference Line
      b. Drop Lines
      c. Tooltip(for whole summary of the company)
