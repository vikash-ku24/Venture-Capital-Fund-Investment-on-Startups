# Venture-Capital-Fund-Investment-on-Startups
There is a Venture Capital Fund who is planning to do an investment on Startups on the basis of:
1. High Revenue 
2. Low Expense 
3. Top Growth

Here I try to solve the business problem by identifying the best startups to invest on the basis of 2015 Growth Rate, 2015 Revenue, 2015 Expense.

I created a dashboard for the Board of Directors throughh which they can find the bets opportunity to invest in future unicorn*

This list consist 1000 startups name through which investor can find the top performer dynamically,
For e.g., if the capital fund wants to invets in top 10 startups then the dashboard will show top 10 startups and in case they want more or less than the dashboard has dynamic set which help them to find the top 5 or top 20 etc startups out of 1000.

The dashboard will represnt the list of all the top companies alongside with Growth Rate, Revenue, Expense.
The business leaders can adjust the cutoff according to their expentancy using diffrent parameters such as revenue cutoff, expense cutoff(these cutoff can go from its actual minimum actual maximum)

I'm including two files:-
1. EDA which helps you to understand the data analysis process and the whole preparation of raw data
2. The dashboard which helps you to find the top startups along side with other modifications like:
      a. Reference Line
      b. Drop Lines
      c. Tooltip(for whole summary of the company)
